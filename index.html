            <b>Twas the Night before Christmas</b><br>
            <i>Toastmasters Version</i><br><br>

Twas the minute before our favourite Xmas meeting<br>
And all through the zoom room, not a member was bleating<br>
The speeches were ready and prepared with care<br>
In hopes that the Evaluator soon would be there<br><br>

The members were sitting all comfy on chairs<br>
While visions of contest rules raised their neck hairs<br>
And the chair in her role, and I ready to speak<br>
Had just settled down, with no time left to tweak<br><br>

When out on the internet there arose such a clatter<br>
I worried and stressed about what was the matter<br>
Away to the zoom master I flew like a flash<br>
Hoping and begging that the system not crash<br><br>

The sound on the zoom room came in loud and clear<br>
And the members of the club all began to cheer<br>
When, what to my searching eyes should appear,<br>
But many miniatures squares of faces so dear<br><br>

With an expert person leading as chair<br>
And a Sergeant at Arms starting us on time by a hair<br>
The meeting began to flow without a hitch<br>
The general evaluator taking notes, as neat as a stitch<br><br>

The rant was on point, and man did they care!<br>
The humorist creative and performed with flair<br>
The timer multi-tasked between computer and phone<br>
It is really is a master skill, taking time to hone<br><br>

The speakers gave us gifts both grand and great<br>
The evaluators were kind, wise, and compelled to state<br>
That Speak your Mind Toastmasters, the best in the land<br>
Has once again proven itself to be truly grand<br><br>

Our year has ended, the new year to begin<br>
So we took a moment to wish to our dear kin<br>
Before clicking end meeting, soon to be out of sight<br>
Happy Christmas to All and to all a Good Night!<br><br>
