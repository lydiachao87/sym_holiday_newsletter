Best lesson from 2021: Define what’s safe for you to stay healthy. Listen to advice from others but make your own decisions. You are the boss of you.<br>
For 2022, I'm looking forward to lots of snow in the winter, and a warm not hot summer. Find some nice person who has the desire and resources to put a rock on my finger deserving of a king or a sultan, maybe even a god, and look after me in a style I would like to become accustomed to.

In 2021, with the gym closed, I got back in the groove of riding my bike for fun and exercise rather than just for transport. And in 2022 I am looking forward to maybe becoming a grandparent (fingers crossed).

            My favorite memory in 2021 was learning how to program until the wee hours of the morning before going to sleep exhausted and happy, especially after seeing my new trinket apps work on my phone! I'm excited to see how else I'll be able to grow in 2022!

            My favorite memory for 2021 is going back and deep-diving into physics and math! The lesson I learned after my company imploded that I'll be carrying to 2022 is to always remember to do regular backups!! I'm most excited to getting some of our projects off the floor in the new year!

My favourite memory of 2021, beside getting my DTM, that I have survived another hurdle in my life and here I am to tell another story. In the new year, I'm looking forward to trying to be better.

I hope this pandemic will help us to see that the whole planet is one large ecosphere.
We as a species have to change our lifestyles. We cannot go back to life as it was before which means some radical changes . Change is always hard to accept but we must tackle the many world problems together if we are to survive the next 100 years
<br>
I sincerely hope that 2022 will be recognised as a turning point, each country  trying to work only in their own interests has to be broadened to consider the consequences of going it alone. The challenges are too great for the same old to continue.

It's okay to ask for help. I don't have to do everything myself - even if I want to. In the new year, I'm looking forward to a milestone birthday and the District 96 Conference  - both in April.

The best lesson I learned in 2021 is that I can get back up when I'm knocked down. For the new year, I'm looking forward to staying out of "the home"!

The best lesson learned: If you don't want to be repeatedly disappointed, please do not count the Covid-19-free chickens before they are hatched. For the new year, I'm looking forward to being able to feel safe enough to fly and travel again.

During this pandemic, I have learned to enjoy nature's moments more and appreciate those little impromptu talks with strangers. Next year, I am looking forward to people being more aware of caring for others and the environment.

Favourite memory:
Standing on the TEDx stage sharing a message I believe is important!   Being on a TED stage has been on my vision board for a few years!!
<br>
Best lesson:  When you truly care about sharing your message, your ego can fall away.  Shifting the focus to your purpose, creates flow by removing the barriers put up by the ego.

Looking forward to 2022: Finally living with my wonderful man and getting to discover what it is like to love and support each other every day!
